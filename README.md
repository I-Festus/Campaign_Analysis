## SKILL AND CONCEPT DEMONSTRATED
This analysis showcases a variety of technical skills and conceptual knowledge in SQL and marketing analytics:
1. SQL Querying and Data Manipulation
- Aggregation Functions: SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() to calculate total impressions, engagement scores, and conversions.
- Filtering and Conditions: WHERE and NULLIF() to exclude invalid or zero values.
- Sorting and Ranking: ORDER BY to rank campaigns, locations, and marketing channels.
- Grouping Data: GROUP BY to analyze trends across campaigns, locations, and target audiences.
- String Manipulation: REPLACE() to clean and convert cost-related fields.

2. Database Setup
To begin the analysis, a PostgreSQL database named campaign was created. The following SQL query was used to create the campaigndata table with appropriate data types:
CREATE TABLE campaigndata ( Campaign_ID INT, Company VARCHAR (100), Campaign_Type VARCHAR(50), Target_Audience VARCHAR (100), Duration VARCHAR (50), Channel_Used VARCHAR (50), Conversion_Rate NUMERIC, Acquisition_Cost MONEY, ROI NUMERIC, Location VARCHAR (100), Date VARCHAR (50), Clicks INT, Impressions INT, Engagement_Score NUMERIC, Customer_Segment VARCHAR (100));
